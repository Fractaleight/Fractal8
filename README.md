We regret to inform you of a delay in the Fractal 8 project. Unfortunately, our primary communication channel, our Twitter account, was unexpectedly suspended, likely flagged as spam due to the high volume of engagement and interest from our community. We are actively working to resolve this issue, as it has significantly impacted our ability to connect with our supporters.

In addition to this setback, Fractal’s recent performance challenges and our mint not reaching a sell-out have led us to reassess our approach. We remain fully committed to delivering both the artwork and token, albeit on a revised timeline. This is not an abandonment of our project; rather, it’s an adjustment to ensure we meet our community’s expectations effectively.

We are dedicated to Fractal 8 and will provide the promised artwork on Fractal Layer 2 on Bitcoin, along with the rune token as detailed in our roadmap. We are also exploring a sale to an experienced and trusted buyer who shares our vision and has a proven track record.

We understand that delays can be disappointing, and we truly appreciate your patience and understanding as we navigate these challenges. Thank you for standing with us during this unexpected turn, and rest assured, our commitment to the project remains unwavering.
